# pdf-reader-gpui

This is a GUI program that renders PDF files.

The GUI is implemented using [`gpui`](https://www.gpui.rs/): "A fast, productive UI framework for Rust from the creators of Zed".

## Usage

- Build a release version locally using `cargo build --release` then run `target/release/pdf-reader-gpui.exe`.
- Or download a precompiled executable from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/Lej77/pdf-reader-gpui/releases).
- When developing use: `cargo run`

### `cargo install`

You can use `cargo install` to easily build from source without manually cloning the repo:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/Lej77/pdf-reader-gpui.git
```

You can use [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to easily download the precompiled executables from a GitHub release:

```bash
cargo binstall --git https://github.com/Lej77/pdf-reader-gpui.git pdf-reader-gpui
```

After installing you can update the program using [nabijaczleweli/cargo-update: A cargo subcommand for checking and applying updates to installed executables](https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update):

```bash
cargo install-update --git pdf-reader-gpui

# OR update all installed programs:
cargo install-update --git --all
```

You can uninstall uisng:

```bash
 cargo uninstall pdf-reader-gpui
```
